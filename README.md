# CoreML

`coreml` is an end-to-end machine learning framework aimed at supporting rapid prototyping. It is built on top of PyTorch by combining the several components of any ML pipeline, right from definining the dataset object, choosing how to sample each batch, preprocessing your inputs and labels, iterating on different network architectures, applying various weight initializations, running pretrained models, freezing certain layers, changing optimizers, adding learning rate schedulers, and detailed logging, into a simple `model.fit()` framework, similar to [`scikit-learn`](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn). The codebase is very modular making it easily extensible for different tasks, modalities and training recipes, avoiding duplication wherever possible. The contents of the README are as follows:

## Setup

Clone the project:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/dalmia/coreml.git
```

### Weights & Biases
We use [`wandb`](http://wandb.com/) for experiment tracking. You'll need to have that set up:
- Install wandb

```bash
$ pip install wandb
```

2. Login to wandb:

```bash
$ wandb login
```

You will be redirected to a link that will show you your `WANDB_API_KEY` .

3. Set the `WANDB_API_KEY` by adding this to your `~/.bashrc` file:
```bash
export WANDB_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

4. Run `source ~/.bashrc`.
5. During training, you'll have an option to turn off `wandb` as well.


### Docker
We use Docker containers to ensure replicability of experiments. You can either fetch the Docker image from DockerHub using the following line:
```bash
$ docker pull adalmia/coreml:v1.0
```
OR

You can build the image using the `DockerFile`:
```bash
$ docker build -t adalmia/coreml:v1.0 .
```

The repository runs inside a Docker container. When creating the container, you need to mount the directory containing data to `/data` and directory where you want to store the ouptuts to `/output` on the container. Make the corresponding changes to `create_container.sh` to mount the respective directories by changing `/path/to/coreml`, `/path/to/data` and `/path/to/outputs` to the appropriate values.

Use the following command to launch a container:

```bash
$ bash create_container.sh
```

## Quickstart
### CIFAR10
- Download and prepare the data
```
$ python tasks/data/classification/CIFAR.py
```

This will create a folder named `CIFAR10` under the directory mounted at `/data` on your container along with default data versions and the required directory structure.

- Since the codebase only supports binary classification for now, the step above also creates a `binary.yml` data version which converts the 10-class problem into a binary classification problem.

- Run training using the default config:
```
$ python training/train.py --wandb -v configs/defaults/binary-cifar-classification.yml
```

The flag `--wandb` is used to ignore using `wandb` for this run. You can view other flags that can be passed using `-h`:
```
root@ip:/workspace/coreml# python training/train.py -h
usage: train.py [-h] -v VERSION [-n NUM_WORKERS] [--debug] [-o] [--resume]
                [--id ID] [--wandb] [-e ENTITY] [-p PROJECT] [--seed SEED]

Trains a model

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v VERSION, --version VERSION
                        path to the experiment config file
  -n NUM_WORKERS, --num_workers NUM_WORKERS
                        number of CPU workers to use
  --debug               specify where a debugging run
  -o, --overfit-batch   specify whether the run is to test overfitting
  --resume              whether to resume experiment in wandb
  --id ID               experiment ID in wandb
  --wandb               whether to ignore using wandb
  -e ENTITY, --entity ENTITY
                        wandb user/org name
  -p PROJECT, --project PROJECT
                        wandb project name
  --seed SEED           seed for the experiment
```

## How-Tos
This section demonstrates the power of everything being parameterized by a config. Refer to `configs/defaults/binary-cifar-classification.yml`
as the base config file on top of which we demonstrate the individual components.

### Optimization

```yaml
model:
    name: classification
    batch_size: 8
    epochs: 1
    optimizer:
      name: SGD
      args:
        lr: 0.001
        momentum: 0.9
        nesterov: true
      scheduler:
        update: epoch
        value: loss
        name: ReduceLROnPlateau
        params:
            mode: 'min'
            factor: 0.1
            patience: 5
            verbose: true
            threshold: 0.0001
            threshold_mode: abs
     loss:
      train:
        name: binary-cross-entropy
        params:
            reduction: none
      val:
        name: binary-cross-entropy
        params:
            reduction: none
```
The above example shows how to set various hyperparameters like the batch size, number of epochs, optimizer, learning rate scheduler and the loss function. The interesting aspect is how the optimizer, learning rate scheduler and the loss function is directly defined in the config file. This is possible because of the [Factory Design Pattern](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/factory_pattern.htm) used throughout the codebase. For `optimizer`, we currently support:
- `SGD`
- `Adam`
- `AdamW`

However, other optimization functions can be simply added by registering their corresponding builders in `coreml/optimizers.py`. For each optimizer, `args` contains any parameters required by their corresponding PyTorch definition.

Similarly, we support multiple learning rate schedulers defined in PyTorch along parameterizing whether the scheduler's step should take place after each batch or after each epoch. This is controlled by the key `update`, which can be one of `['epoch', 'batch']`. The key `value` can be set to decide what parameter should be monitored for the scheduler's step. In the above example, the validation `loss` is being monitored. Currently, we suport the following schedulers:
- `ReduceLROnPlateau`
- `StepLR`
- `CyclicLR`
- `OneCycleLR`
- `MultiStepLR`

We also parameterize the loss function to be used and allow for different loss functions for training and validation. The need for making them different could arise in various situations. One such example is applying label smoothing during training but not during validation.

### Network architectures
The network architecture can be completely defined in the config itself:
```yaml
network:
    name: neural_net
    params:
        config:
        - name: Conv2d
          params:
            in_channels: 3
            out_channels: 64
            kernel_size: 3
        - name: BatchNorm2d
          params:
            num_features: 64
        - name: ReLU
          params: {}
        - name: Conv2d
          params:
            in_channels: 64
            out_channels: 64
            kernel_size: 3
        - name: BatchNorm2d
          params:
            num_features: 64
        - name: ReLU
          params: {}
        - name: AdaptiveAvgPool2d
          params:
            output_size:
            - 1
            - 1
        - name: Flatten
          params: {}
        - name: Linear
          params:
            in_features: 64
            out_features: 64
        - name: ReLU
          params: {}
        - name: Linear
          params:
            in_features: 64
            out_features: 1
```
The `config` key takes as input a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary specifying a layer or a backbone network. Yes, if you want to use a pretrained ResNet, you can simply plug it in as a backbone layer:

```yaml
network:
    name: neural_net
    params:
        config:
        - name: resnet50
          params:
            pretrained: true
            in_channels: 3
        - name: AdaptiveAvgPool2d
          params:
            output_size:
            - 1
            - 1
        - name: Flatten
          params: {}
        - name: Linear
          params:
            in_features: 2048
            out_features: 1
```
Currently, we support a lot of backbones:
- `Resnet` variations: `resnet18`, `resnet34`, `resnet50`, `resnet101`, `resnet152`, `resnext50_32x4d`, `resnext101_32x8d`
- `VGGNet` variations: `vgg11`, `vgg11_bn`, `vgg13`, `vgg13_bn`, `vgg16`, `vgg16_bn`, `vgg19_bn`, `vgg19`
-  `EfficientNet` variations: `efficientnet-b0`, `efficientnet-b4`, `efficientnet-b7`

The implementations for the `Resnet` and `VGGNet` based backbones have been taken from `torchvision.models` and those based on `EfficientNet` are supported by [this](https://github.com/lukemelas/EfficientNet-PyTorch/tree/master/efficientnet_pytorch) PyTorch implementation.

Support for other backbones can be similarly added to `coreml/networks/backbone`.

### Datasets
The datasets to use can be specified as follows:
```yaml
dataset:
    name: classification_dataset
    config:
      - name: CIFAR10
        version: binary
    params: {}
```
Here, `name` is used to decide which `torch.utils.data.Dataset` object to use, as defined in `coreml/data/__init__.py`. `config` takes a list of dataset configs. Each dataset config is a dictionary with `name` as the name of the dataset folder under `/data` and `version` being the specific dataset version to use, present in `/data/{name}/processed/versions`. `params` contains additional arguments that can be passed to the dataset object, as defined in `coreml/data`. When avlues are passed to `params`, they are specified for `train`/`val`/`test` separately:
```yaml
dataset:
    name: classification_dataset
    config:
      - name: CIFAR10
        version
    params:
      train:
        fraction: 0.1
      val:
        fraction: 0.5
```

### Preprocessing

#### Input transform
One the input is loaded, the pipeline for processing the input before it is fed into a batch, can be specified in the config as:
```yaml
signal_transform:
    train:
    - name: Permute
      params:
        order:
          - 2
          - 0
          - 1
    val:
    - name: Permute
      params:
        order:
          - 2
          - 0
          - 1
```
The pipeline for each split (`train`/`val`) is specified separately. For each split, a list of dictonaries are given. Each dictionary
represents one transform, as defined in `coreml/data/transforms.py`, using the `name` of the transform and the arguments for that transform.

#### Annotation transform
The raw annotations might have to be transformed before processing as well. This is specified in the config as:
```yaml
target_transform:
    name: classification
    params:
      classes:
        - 0
        - 1
```
The specific target transform is selected from `annotation_factory` inside `coreml/data/transforms.py`

## Testing
We use `unittest` for all our tests. Simply run the following inside the Docker container:
```
$ python -m unittest discover tests
```

## TODOs
- Tracking inputs on W&B (currently `torch.cat` on `epoch_data` kills the process for large inputs).
- Add augmentations
- Support for audio classification
- Support for multi-class classification
- Add benchmarks for multiple datasets
- Add documentation for using new datasets and configuring different parts of the pipeline
